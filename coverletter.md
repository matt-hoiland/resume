Dear Sirs:

I am writing to you to apply for the Regression Tester job posting. I am interested in this position as I have already been working in its entry level form since April and have found it very fulfilling. I have a broad range of technical skills which have been well utilized the last few months, providing what I consider to be great value to Vivint and our customers.

I am prepared to meet the rising challenges this job presents. As Vivint continues to innovate both for our customers and our own development process, I will bring essential skills and values. First, I strive to balance a sharp eye for detail with a greater understanding of context and purpose. Second, I value documentation not as something to be completed but as a means of communication. Finally, my education in software engineering enables me to operate cross-functionally and flexibly.

I have included my resume which records my work experience over the last few years as well as relevant academic work. I would like to bring your attention to my time as a teaching assistant for the BYU computer science department. In that role I had unique opportunities among my colleagues to work on our suite of testing software which graded the code of hundreds of students per semester. These tests needed to be well designed in coverage, case partitions, boundary conditions, error states, and most importantly accurate to the acceptance criteria provided by professors. A challenge I found particularly rewarding was providing actionable feedback to my students based on test results.

I have exercised similar skills in my current position. In addition to my primary responsibility of executing regression test runs against our app releases, I have reviewed our suites for redundancy, efficiency, and compliance to acceptance criteria. I have also made efforts to network with our automation QA teams. As Vivint's services increase in capacity, our tests suites increase in complexity. I have the inertia, in-house knowledge, and ability to help push us forward.

My time at Vivint has provided me with more opportunity and personal fulfillment than I expected. With Customer Solutions I gained sincere empathy for the perspective of our customers, and my work so far on the regression team has shown me the essential role of quality assurance. I am eager to continue this work. Thank you in advance for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you.

Gratefully,
